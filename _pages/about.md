:wave: Welcome! :wave:

My name is Patrick May, I am a 4th year computer science student at the College of Wooster, minoring in Mathematics and Music. My specific interests in the software development world are on lower level development, energy efficient computing, and secure programming. Beyond the technical, I want to use my interdisciplinary experience as a liberal arts student to understand the broader context of where technology fits into our current world. My current college commitments include: 

- **Course Assistant** for *CSCI 200: Algorithm Analysis* (Spring 2024)
- **Trustee** of the *Hans H. Jenny Investment Club*
- **Cellist** in the *Wooster Symphony*
- **Captain/Enthusiast** in the *Wooster Competitive Programming Team*

Currently I am embarking on my [Senior Independent Thesis](https://wooster.edu/academics/research/is/) as part of my requirements for graduation. As a computer science major, I am personally interested in understanding *energy costs* of running programs. In my Junior Independent Study, a heavily whittled down semester long project, I worked towards *dynamic program analysis* by creating a simple profiling tool [:cow: Prof](https://github.com/patrick-may/Energy-Efficiency-Profiler). As a senior, I am working on making a *static analysis* tool for understanding energy costs of simple programs. Additionally, I am both working part time for my past summer internship role as a QA Automation Engineer @ Webstaurant and searching for new graduate roles. My personal software interests lie within **performance** and **efficiency** engineering existing systems.

In the summer of 2023, I gained a lot of experience as a quality assurance automation intern working at WebstaurantStore. More insights about my most recent summer experience can be found in my blog post [here](/blog/2023/webstaurant-qa-internship). 

In the summer of 2022, I learned a lot performing novel research as part of [Carnegie Mellon's REUSE 2022 Cohort](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/), in which I did secure programming research in education with the guidance of [Dr. Hanan Hibshi](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/about/team/hibshi.html). 

In years prior, I have gained significant interpersonal networking and leadership skills through positions such as [student ARCHer](https://wooster.edu/new-students/arch/) at my college, presenting various Keynote speeches, and multiple other pieces of activism for the [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/?_ga=2.256433355.1559959825.1672760857-605331151.1672760857&_gac=1.117230324.1672760857.CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylL7jbQLNYwkMHAZC2XysOBc2f8SxeQpfNZock7sfpbuG69xhCGylZRoCMAwQAvD_BwE).

Feel free to reach out if any questions arise when perusing my portfolio -- happy to network about computer science, academica, being a developer, etc. etc.

-Patrick
