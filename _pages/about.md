Thanks for stopping by :sunglasses:!

I am a currently a computer science student at the College of Wooster. I am also minoring in Mathematics and Music. While I am a student first, I also am involved in various on-campus activities, such as:
- **Vice President** of *Jenny Investment Club*
- **Teaching Assistant** for *MATH 130: Mathematical Foundations of Computing*
- **Lab Technician** for Wooster's *Virtual Reality Lab*
- **Cellist** in the *Wooster Symphony*

I currently find myself with too many computer science interests to pursue all at once. I enjoy creating a tangible product that comes along with software engineering. I also currently having a lot of fun self-teaching some introductory cybersecurity practices that are more of the 'IT' field. Finally, I enjoy the theoretical side of computer science, learning new math and algorithms (even though theoretical computer science is scary hard!)

Last summer, I learned a lot performing novel research as part of [Carnegie Mellon's REUSE 2022 Cohort](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/), in which I did secure programming research in education with the guidance of [Dr. Hanan Hibshi](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/about/team/hibshi.html). 

In years prior, I have gained significant interpersonal networking and leadership skills through positions such as [student ARCHer](https://wooster.edu/new-students/arch/) at my college, presenting various Keynote speeches, and multiple other pieces of activism for the [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/?_ga=2.256433355.1559959825.1672760857-605331151.1672760857&_gac=1.117230324.1672760857.CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylL7jbQLNYwkMHAZC2XysOBc2f8SxeQpfNZock7sfpbuG69xhCGylZRoCMAwQAvD_BwE).

I hope to explore industry work through a summer 2023 internship, and then I returning to Wooster to complete my [Senior Independent Study](https://wooster.edu/academics/research/is/) at Wooster, a year long exploration and involved, individual research project.
