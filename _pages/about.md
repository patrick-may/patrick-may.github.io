:wave: Hello! 

My name is Patrick May, I am a new graduate that recently finished my computer science degree at the College of Wooster, minoring in Mathematics and Music. My specific interests in the software development world are on programming languages and program analysis, both static and dynamic. My quest of understanding the ennumerable abstractions in modern day software is always ongoing as well. I scratch my artistic itch through playing my cello both individually and in a larger group. 
Currently, I am transitioning from my undergraduate experience to full time work in my field of study (an incredibly lucky position).
Hence, I am not currently looking for further work opportunities, but am always happy to chat.

In my final year of undergrad, I completed my [Senior Independent Thesis](https://wooster.edu/academics/research/is/) as part of my requirements for graduation. I personally find energy costs of programming to be a fascinating area of research, so my senior thesis ended up being a preliminary expedition into the field of static analysis in the context of energy modeling of the ARM assembly language. As a junior, I investigated *dynamic program analysis* by creating a simple profiling tool [:cow: Prof](https://github.com/patrick-may/Energy-Efficiency-Profiler). 

In the summer of 2023, I gained a lot of experience as a quality assurance automation intern working at WebstaurantStore. More insights about my most recent summer experience can be found in my blog post [here](/blog/2023/webstaurant-qa-internship). 

In the summer of 2022, I learned a lot performing novel research as part of [Carnegie Mellon's REUSE 2022 Cohort](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/), in which I did secure programming research in education with the guidance of [Dr. Hanan Hibshi](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/about/team/hibshi.html). 

In years prior, I have gained significant interpersonal networking and leadership skills through positions such as [student ARCHer](https://wooster.edu/new-students/arch/) at my college, presenting various Keynote speeches, and multiple other pieces of activism for the [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/?_ga=2.256433355.1559959825.1672760857-605331151.1672760857&_gac=1.117230324.1672760857.CjwKCAiAwc-dBhA7EiwAxPRylL7jbQLNYwkMHAZC2XysOBc2f8SxeQpfNZock7sfpbuG69xhCGylZRoCMAwQAvD_BwE).

Feel free to reach out if any questions arise when perusing my portfolio -- happy to network about computer science, academica, being a developer, etc. etc.

-Patrick
