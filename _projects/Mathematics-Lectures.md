As a STEM Zone Intern (for all intents and purposes, essentially a lead teaching assistant) for MATH 130, I had the amazing opportunity to research, compile, and present two lectures for the class. This "project post" is meant to serve as a repository for these lectures.

[Combinatorics Lecture, 26 February 2023]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/lect1.pdf)

[Combinatorics Lecture, 29 September 2023]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/lect2.pdf)

[Discrete Math Applications, 29 November 2023]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/lect3.pdf)

Above was a much more free-form discussion, end-of-semester wrap up, and career focused discussion. 
As such, the slides are only a starting point -- the talking side was more involved. 
If you are curious about any of the reasonings behind ideas and what are on the slides, feel free to reach out! 
It was a ton of fun to lecture off-the-beaten path of intro math topics.
