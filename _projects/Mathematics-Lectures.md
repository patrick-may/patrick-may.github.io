As a STEM Zone Intern (for all intents and purposes, essentially a lead teaching assistant) for MATH 130, I had the amazing opportunity to research, compile, and present two lectures for the class. This "project post" is meant to serve as a repository for these lectures.

The first lecture I prepared was a broad introduction to Combinatorics:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/pdf/lect1.pdf" title="Lecture 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
