My senior undergraduate thesis. 
This post serves as both a postmortem woven with my personal thoughts, as well as a summary of the big picture steps of the thesis. 
At the end, I step back to share a little bit about my opinions on the overall structure and experience of Wooster's `Independent Study'.

That being said, you can read instead read the  
[full thesis here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/seniorthesis.pdf).

Alternatively, I made a [poster for our symposium]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/seniorthesis-poster.pdf) that one may find a useful summary, although it trims a lot of the finer details of my project.
