# Winter Break
I thought maybe a personal website would be something fun to have in the future, so I sat down over winter break to try and get something going with github pages, which I knew were free.

However, after various different attempts of a mostly-from-scratch attempt, I swallowed my pride and found this very nice looking template repository to start from. The site is mostly personalized with my information now, but the instead of understanding everything like I would in a more from-scratch attempt, now I face the difficulty of trying to make everything work within a software system I do not fully understand. 

I look forward to adding more stuff to this blog and more information and features to this website as we progress. 

Thanks for reading!
