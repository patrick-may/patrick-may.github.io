Summer 2023 is closing up! In an effort to confirm my knowledge and experiences from my summer internship, I will do my best to 'teach' is to the bottomless internet void!

# Prior

My internship search quite hectic. I think I applied to a couple hundred positions. I had a couple opportunities string me along for the better part of 8 months (which is a hiring critique for another time). Webstaurant was an opportunity I applied to later, and I have nothing but respect and positives to say about the recruitment process. Within 1-2 weeks I had a direct 1-on-1 phone call with a qa team manager! No multi step technical assessment prior to finding a real person, no HireVue, even the web application/resume drop portion was not excessive (I'm looking at you, financial orgs that have designed an in-house CMS such that wants to know the name of every pet rock I've ever had ðŸ˜­). After our phone call, I had a very brief take-home technical assessment... and that was it for the hard part on my end. I cannot state how much it left me with a good feeling about the org to be legitimately given someone's attention during the hiring process.  

This tech role was a remote position, for which I recieved a large work-at-home supply drop about a week before starting. 

# Getting Started

My summer experience started relatively quietly. Going into this internship, I had no prior experience with any quality assurance work. My first week started with a few small orientation sessions, and then I was working through a training bootcamp. Webstaurant has an Automation framework build off of Selenium, wrapping in the JVM language `Groovy`. As someone who has never used Groovy before and hasn't done significant work in Java before either, there was a learning curve to Groovy scripting, and the in automation framework. 

Training involved working through pre-solved practice QA tickets. I have always personally been more interested in back-end development work, so working on emulating how a human interfaces to the front-end also took some getting used to. The main thing here was learning the concept of `XPaths`, and finding elements in a website's DOM in XML form. I am sure this is something trivial to many, but it was a first for me!! I didn't even know that chrome dev tools allowed one to `ctrl-f` and search for an xPath -- I was just interpolating the raw html and utilizing the JS console to see if my xpath was valid. (I eventually learned there are vastly superior ways to finding and checking XPaths).

My QA team was a group of around 10-15 people, with one manager, a team lead, and a distribution of different levels of analysts and automation engineers. Team dynamics were overall very positive and supportive. Our team loosely followed an Agile methodology, with daily standups, weekly checkins and sizing meetings, retrospectives after sprints, etc. etc. Whenever I faced an problems, I always recieved help as long as I asked for it. Knowing when to ask and when to grind is an impossible question (elaborated on further below).

# Day to Day

In all honesty, day-to-day work was quite routine. Our team had standup, which afterwards I worked individually on whatever automation tickets I had on my plate for that sprint. After breaking for lunch, I had another substantial block of time to focus on individual work. In the last few hours of the day, our team had '`office hours`', which boiled down to a groupwork/troubleshooting/socialization space. Plus/Minus an additional meeting or two each day, and that was the general routine! If anyone has more specialized questions about working at Webstaurant, feel free to DM.  

Automation tickets for me were pulled from an **existing backlog** of sized Product Backlog Items (PBIs). During my ~10 week internship, I completed around 15 PBIs with an average size estimate sitting between 5 (18 hrs)/ 8 (30 hrs) of effort per PBI. Aside from individual work, I also contributed in weekly sizing meetings that built our backlog of automation PBIs. 

# Internship Specifics

Along with my regular work, there were a couple additional responsibilities and opportunities that were available just to summer interns.
