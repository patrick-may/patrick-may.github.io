# patrick-may.github.io
A personal portfolio website, that along the way I am pushing myself to learn more of Java Script.

As github pages has some specific requirements in what it can use to host a website, I am using *Jekyll* to get something started, as opposed to a nodejs app that I initially started with. The main documentation I am starting from is found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
